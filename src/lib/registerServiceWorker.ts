//
// PRODUCTION ONLY, and that is not a cautious default. A service worker in
// front of the dev server serves modules Vite has already replaced, so HMR
// appears to work and the page keeps rendering the previous edit — the worst
// failure mode available, because it looks like the code is wrong.
//
// `updateViaCache: 'none'` makes the browser revalidate sw.js itself on every
// registration rather than serving it from the HTTP cache. Without it a
// deployment can be up to 24 hours late to a phone that already has the app.
//
// Failure is deliberately silent. A worker that will not register (private
// browsing, an unsupported WebView, an http:// origin) costs the user nothing —
// the app is a plain web app without it — so there is nothing here worth
// interrupting somebody's morning with.
